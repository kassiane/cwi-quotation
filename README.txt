This is my solution for the problem proposed by CWI for the technical interview.

This is a lib and in the service class (CBCurrencyService) you can find the method asked by the proposed problem.
Also, you can find its .jar (cwi-quotation-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar) in the root folder.
	
TO RUN THE TESTS:

	1) You must have Maven and Java installed

	2) In your prompt go to the folder where you unzipped the project
		$ mvn test
